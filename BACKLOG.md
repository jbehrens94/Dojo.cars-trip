| ✅      | user | electric vehicles to have properties like battery capacity, energy consumption, and current charge | the system can correctly represent the state of EVs     | - EVs must have batteryCapacity (kWh) property<br>- EVs must have energyConsumption (kWh/100km) property<br>- EVs must start with currentCharge = 0 kWh                                                           |
| ✅      | user | to be able to charge an electric vehicle by adding energy in kWh                                   | the EV can store energy for travel                      | - EVs must exposes a method to charge<br>-Charging increases the currentCharge up to the maximum batteryCapacity limit<br>-Charging does not affect gasoline vehicles                                             |
| ✅      | user | to retrieve the current battery charge level of an EV                                              | I can monitor energy availability                       | - EV exposes a method currentCharge(): number returning current charge in kWh<br>- Gasoline cars retain their currentFuel method or equivalent showing fuel                                                       |
| ✅      | user | to not be able to overcharge my EV beyond the maximum capacity                                     | my car doesn't break                                    | - EV implements a check in charge(kWh) method to check for overcharging<br> - In case of overcharging, battery charge is set to maximum capacity.                                                                 |                                                                |
| ✅     | user | the travel behavior of EVs to use energy consumption calculations                                  | the driving simulation reflects actual battery drainage | - EV travel reduces currentCharge based on distance and energyConsumption (kWh/100km)<br>- Gasoline cars travel reduces fuel as before<br>- Attempting to travel without sufficient charge/fuel prevents the trip |
| 📋     | user | the data representation of EVs to include the current battery charge                               | I can observe vehicle status accurately                 | - data() method for EV shows currentCharge instead of currentFuel<br>- Gasoline cars' data() output remains unchanged showing fuel level                                                                          |
